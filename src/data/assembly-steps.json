Build the key matrix (switches + diodes)\n2. Connect the microcontroller\n3. Add optional features (RGB, OLED, encoders)\n4. Flash firmware\n5. Test every key\n6. Final assembly into case\n\n**Common first-time mistakes to avoid:**\n- Soldering controller before testing matrix\n- Wrong diode orientation (very common!)\n- Forgetting to test before case assembly\n- Flashing wrong firmware for controller type\n\n**Time management:**\nPlan for these approximate times:\n- Matrix assembly: 3-8 hours (depends on method)\n- Wiring controller: 1-2 hours\n- Firmware setup: 1-3 hours (first time)\n- Testing and troubleshooting: 1-2 hours\n- Case assembly: 30-60 minutes\n\nDon't rush.

Perfect for nice!nano builds.\n\n**Why ZMK for wireless?**\n- Designed for low power consumption\n- Native Bluetooth support\n- No USB cable needed between halves\n- Active development and community\n\n**ZMK uses GitHub Actions for building:**\nYou don't need to install anything locally! Firmware builds in the cloud.\n\n**Setup process:**\n\n1. **Fork ZMK config repository:**\n   - Visit https://github.com/zmkfirmware/unified-zmk-config-template\n   - Click \"Use this template\" → \"Create new repository\"\n   - Name it: `zmk-config` (or whatever you prefer)\n   - Set to Public (required for GitHub Actions free tier)\n\n2. **Configure your keyboard:**\n   - Edit `config/boards/shields/your_keyboard/your_keyboard.conf`\n   - Set keyboard name, manufacturer\n   - Configure split settings:\n     ```\n     CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT=y\n     CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE=y\n     CONFIG_ZMK_SLEEP=y\n     ```\n\n3. **Configure keymap:**\n   - Edit `config/your_keyboard.keymap`\n   - Uses devicetree syntax (different from QMK)\n   - Define layers, keys, behaviors\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     bindings = <\n       &kp ESC  &kp Q  &kp W  &kp E  &kp R\n       &kp TAB  &kp A  &kp S  &kp D  &kp F\n     >;\n     ```\n\n4. **Commit and push:**\n   - Commit your changes to GitHub\n   - GitHub Actions automatically builds firmware\n   - Wait 5-10 minutes for build to complete\n   - Download .uf2 files from Actions tab\n\n5. **Flash to controllers:**\n   - nice!nano uses UF2 bootloader (drag-and-drop)\n   - Double-press reset button on nice!nano\n   - It appears as USB drive\n   - Drag .uf2 file to drive\n   - Controller auto-reboots\n   - Repeat for both halves (left and right have different files)\n\n**Pairing keyboards:**\n1. Turn on both halves\n2. They auto-pair with each other\n3. On computer: Open Bluetooth settings\n4. Look for keyboard name\n5. Click to pair\n6. Start typing!",

Single key not working:**\n- **Most likely:** Cold solder joint on that specific switch\n- **Check:** Diode orientation for that key\n- **Fix:** Reflow solder joints, verify diode direction\n- **Test:** Use multimeter to check continuity through switch when pressed\n\n**2. Entire row not working:**\n- **Most likely:** Row wire not connected to controller\n- **Check:** Solder joint at controller pin, continuity along entire row\n- **Fix:** Check firmware pin configuration, reflow controller solder joints\n- **Test:** Measure voltage on row pin when key pressed (should change)\n\n**3. Entire column not working:**\n- **Most likely:** Column wire not connected to controller, or diodes wrong orientation\n- **Check:** Diode orientation in that column, controller pin solder joint\n- **Fix:** Reflow joints, check firmware pin configuration\n- **Test:** Continuity test through diodes (should conduct one direction only)\n\n**4. Multiple random keys not working:**\n- **Most likely:** Multiple cold solder joints or intermittent connections\n- **Check:** All solder joints visually (shiny and smooth?)\n- **Fix:** Reflow all suspicious joints\n- **Test:** Wiggle keyboard gently while testing - intermittent means mechanical issue\n\n**5. Keys registering multiple times:**\n- **Most likely:** Switch bounce (normal firmware handles this), or stuck switch\n- **Check:** Firmware debounce settings, physical switch operation\n- **Fix:** Adjust debounce time in firmware, replace switch if defective\n\n**6. Wrong keys registering:**\n- **Most likely:** Firmware matrix configuration wrong\n- **Check:** Keymap file - verify row/column assignment\n- **Fix:** Update firmware with correct matrix\n\n**Diagnostic tools:**\n\n**Multimeter continuity test:**\n1. Set multimeter to continuity mode (beep mode)\n2. Press and hold switch\n3. Measure from row wire to column wire\n4. Should beep when pressed, silent when released\n5. If backwards, diode is backwards\n\n**Visual inspection:**\n1. Look at every solder joint under good lighting\n2. Shiny = good, Dull/grainy = cold joint\n3. Too much solder = potential bridge\n4. Too little = poor connection\n\n**Firmware debugging:**\n1. Enable debug output in firmware (if supported)\n2. Monitor serial console\n3. Press problem keys - see if firmware detects them\n4.

Firmware functionality:**\n- [ ] Macros execute correctly\n- [ ] Key combos work as configured\n- [ ] Tap/hold functions behave correctly\n- [ ] Auto-shift works (if enabled)\n- [ ] Bootloader can be accessed (reset key or button)\n\n**5. Physical inspection:**\n- [ ] All switches are firmly mounted\n- [ ] No loose wires or components\n- [ ] No sharp edges that could cut fingers\n- [ ] Controller is securely mounted\n- [ ] TRRS jacks are firmly soldered\n\n**6. Performance test:**\n- [ ] Fast typing feels responsive\n- [ ] No noticeable input lag\n- [ ] N-key rollover works (press 6+ keys simultaneously)\n- [ ] Gaming sequences work smoothly (if relevant)\n\n**Real-world typing test:**\n1. Open a text editor\n2. Type several paragraphs at your normal speed\n3. Try fast typing bursts\n4. Use common shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc.)\n5. Test any workflows specific to your use case\n\n**Stress test:**\n1. Press many keys simultaneously\n2. Rapidly alternate between keys\n3. Hold modifiers and press multiple keys\n4. Switch layers rapidly while typing\n5. If gaming: test your game's key bindings\n\n**If everything passes:**\n- Take final photos of your build before case assembly\n- Save your firmware files (source and compiled)\n- Document your build in a note file (pin assignments, quirks, etc.)\n- Proceed to final assembly!\n\n**If issues remain:**\n- Go back to troubleshooting steps\n- Don't proceed to case assembly until keyboard is 100% functional\n- It's better to spend extra time now than to disassemble later",
